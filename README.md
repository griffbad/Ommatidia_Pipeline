# Ommatidia_Pipeline

This was built as part of my undergraduate thesis (also included in this Github). 
For sample data to test on, download [this](https://uchicago.box.com/s/sr4zn8d9dcgxahpap11qoq5txd0r1lsn). It is a nocturnal specimen acquired with the methods described in my thesis. Each voxel is 600nm^3 (set px_to_nm = 600).
